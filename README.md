VBA scripting challenge
I had a study group with Nick and Kahlid where we went over out code to work out bugs and fix errors. I hadn't added ws. to my cells and that was a major error they helped me work out, and I am thankful.
I also received clarification on what <> did in the code and was able to properly implement it afterwards. 
My biggest edit to my code was moving all of the variable dim to the top of the code rather than adding them when they first appeared; makes the script look a lot nicer and is much easier to read.
I was also able to go over my code with Brian durring office hours and he pointed out that my stock tickers were not stackning up correctly and pointed me to the credit card example we did in class.
